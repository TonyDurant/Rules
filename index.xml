      <description> Rule #12: &amp;ldquo;Learn foreign languages.&amp;rdquo; 1
 Learn at least one of the major ones such as French, German, Spanish. 2
  Originally created and published in Mar 2010 &amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;
 It depends on your country of origin, of course. For instance, for Russian native speakers, the list would be English, French, German. &amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;

      <description>Who wrote military regulations? The very bluebook of &amp;ldquo;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops.&amp;rdquo; I am pretty sure there is an author or a group of authors to that. But I truly believe that life is the true author of military regulations. Salty sweat and sticky blood of the soldiers seal all the chapters of the book. Same with &amp;ldquo;The Rules&amp;rdquo;, ‚Äî life is the true author of it.</description>

      <description>Gift a loaf of bread to a poor boy from the slums in a remote village. He&amp;rsquo;ll be in the seventh heaven of happiness and delight.
Gift a new car to a rich boy from a luxury mansion in a wealthy neighborhood. He&amp;rsquo;ll probably be in the seventh heaven of happiness and delight, either.
Let&amp;rsquo;s compare the level of happiness for both of the boys; it&amp;rsquo;s roughly identical. However, the amount of money spent on the loaf of bread and the car is drastically different.</description>

      <description>Tell me, what is that? Some sort of greed to fill up your coffee mug full up to the rim? Like that:
And then, with a peculiar gait, trying not to spill it, carry it to a dining table. I just looked through my window and didn&amp;rsquo;t see a war, or a burst of hunger there, which would cause us to fights for every single ounce and milliliter of boiling water for our drinks.</description>

      <description>They kiss each other tenderly. Mouth to mouth. The movie credits start rolling up. What is going to happen next? For some reason that stays behind the scenes all the time. They have gone through fire and water to get to their goal. Love. But how is love continued? Here is the kiss he&amp;rsquo;s been fighting for throughout the entire movie.
What is next? What is going to happen tomorrow? After the credits.</description>

      <description>I bet you can relate to the following: you get into the car, start the engine, been driving for a while and suddenly you smell it. A distinct smell of something burning. The hand brake! You glimpse at the e-brake lever, and it&amp;rsquo;s engaged. &amp;ldquo;Oh dummy me,&amp;rdquo; you think.
Another one. In winter. Parked your car at night and as a matter of habit, you engage your e-brake. In the morning, when the brake pads froze to the rotors you can&amp;rsquo;t even move the car.</description>

      <title>#7 - A Simple Solution</title>

      <description>Rule #7: &amp;ldquo;Every problem has a simple solution.&amp;rdquo; 1
 If it seems there is no simple solution to a problem, that means the solution is yet to be found. Only a shortsighted mind that is bound to overcomplicate things, is burdened to block itself in a dead-end of a thought process. Trust me, even seemingly unsolvable problems have a solution. Here is an example.
No human is perfect. I am colorblind.</description>

      <description>We are surrounded by items and people we like. Even more, some of them we genuinely love. However, unfortunately, an effect comes into place after we&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of time with the before-mentioned, akin to a static electricity accumulation.
The static electricity is made of fatigue and banality.
A similar thing happens to you at work. It&amp;rsquo;s barely possible to love the work over a long period. As a solution to that, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to leave for a vacation occasionally.</description>

      <title>#5 - Black and White</title>

      <description>Life doesn&amp;rsquo;t consist of black and white. There are always the shades of grey which fill the void between them with a gradient. In life, nothing can be unequivocally evaluated. I can only say with a degree of certainty that objectivity is vague and can be arguably existent in mathematics and physics. Also, people say there is some level of objectivity while looking through the viewfinder of a video recorder.</description>

      <description>Hey, I guess we are warming up here. Here is another small one.
 Rule #4: &amp;ldquo;Always Follow the Rules.&amp;rdquo; 1
 And, yes, I know, some of you would argue that there are occasions where you would step aside from following certain rules. I know it; everyone knows it. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time talking about that.
Nonetheless, some of us follow the rules subconsciously.
All in all, if you want that everything goes smoothly, follow the rules.</description>

      <title>#3 - Propulsion</title>

      <description>Propulsion creates a driving force leading to movement. It makes the world go around, makes people achieve the goals and desired dreams. Everything in the world moves because of the nature of propulsion. Where it comes from, that hidden force?
For instance, wind derives its driving force from the pressure difference in two points. Electricity, from the electric potential difference. Sensible heat, from the temperature difference. What about people? What is a driving force for us, human beings?</description>

      <description>I am pretty sure you have done this before: you‚Äôd ordered the main course, salad, and an appetizer in a restaurant and then realized you are not going to finish the entire dish. Your stomach simply couldn‚Äôt accommodate all that tasty food.
The same story happened with my friends and me in Munich (Germany, Bavaria). In a restaurant by the central railway station, we decided to make an order. I was hungry.</description>

      <description>If my memory serves me right, I wanted to tell you something. However, I have no recollection of what it was.
 Well, rule #1 then: ‚ÄúNever rely on your memory. Every major thing has to be written down.‚Äù 1, 2

 üëã ‚Äî Hello, 2020 Anton here, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a better rule during the pandemic time. An idea is not worth even a dime if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been written down.</description>
