      <description>Propulsion creates a driving force leading to movement. It makes the world go around, makes people achieve the goals and desired dreams. Everything in the world moves because of the nature of propulsion. Where it comes from, that hidden force?
For instance, wind derives its driving force from the pressure difference in two points. Electricity, from the electric potential difference. Sensible heat, from the temperature difference. What about people? What is a driving force for us, human beings?</description>
