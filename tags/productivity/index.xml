      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t get better over time. With every passing day, our abilities and capabilities to do something useful deplete. 1
Many people dream of traveling somewhere nice and beautiful. But in the future, we won&amp;rsquo;t have that much energy and resources to do so. We will all have our commitments to take care of or rather to serve to such as a mortgage, car loans, work, significant others. You know that.</description>

      <description>Due to the nature of my work, I design-support the consulting engineers with equipment and system selections. Over time, working on a specific project we go through many revision iterations. I duplicate, say, &amp;lsquo;Revision 0&amp;rsquo; into &amp;lsquo;Revision 1&amp;rsquo; and modify the content to tailor it to the new conditions and requests. Then &amp;lsquo;Revision 2&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Revision 3&amp;rsquo; emerge. However, there is a moment in time when it&amp;rsquo;s hard to track all of the changes.</description>

      <description>Who wrote military regulations? The very bluebook of &amp;ldquo;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops.&amp;rdquo; I am pretty sure there is an author or a group of authors to that. But I truly believe that life is the true author of military regulations. Salty sweat and sticky blood of the soldiers seal all the chapters of the book. Same with &amp;ldquo;The Rules&amp;rdquo;, â€” life is the true author of it.</description>
