      <description>Sometimes when I am browsing the internet I get upset quite easily. In the comment sections, people express themselves incorrectly with spelling and grammar errors. It was a bigger deal back in my old country, Russia. However, the English domain suffers from that too.
You would argue, who am I, a non-native speaker, to critic and bash on how English people express their feelings in writing. Honestly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what language you speak.</description>
