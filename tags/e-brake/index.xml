      <description>I bet you can relate to the following: you get into the car, start the engine, been driving for a while and suddenly you smell it. A distinct smell of something burning. The hand brake! You glimpse at the e-brake lever, and it&amp;rsquo;s engaged. &amp;ldquo;Oh dummy me,&amp;rdquo; you think.
Another one. In winter. Parked your car at night and as a matter of habit, you engage your e-brake. In the morning, when the brake pads froze to the rotors you can&amp;rsquo;t even move the car.</description>
