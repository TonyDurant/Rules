      <description>Here is an illustration for you to fuel up your associations. Life is akin to a railroad we are moving along towing the carriages as if we were a locomotive. The carriages represent the people, the items, and the objects we value and love in our life. We, the engine attached to the front of the train, shoulder all the weight and responsibilities. When we start feeling that some of the carriages are empty, it only adds up weight with no significant benefit to us.</description>
