      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t get better over time. With every passing day, our abilities and capabilities to do something useful deplete. 1
Many people dream of traveling somewhere nice and beautiful. But in the future, we won&amp;rsquo;t have that much energy and resources to do so. We will all have our commitments to take care of or rather to serve to such as a mortgage, car loans, work, significant others. You know that.</description>

      <title>#16 - Empty Carriage</title>

      <description>Here is an illustration for you to fuel up your associations. Life is akin to a railroad we are moving along towing the carriages as if we were a locomotive. The carriages represent the people, the items, and the objects we value and love in our life. We, the engine attached to the front of the train, shoulder all the weight and responsibilities. When we start feeling that some of the carriages are empty, it only adds up weight with no significant benefit to us.</description>

      <description>We are surrounded by items and people we like. Even more, some of them we genuinely love. However, unfortunately, an effect comes into place after we&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of time with the before-mentioned, akin to a static electricity accumulation.
The static electricity is made of fatigue and banality.
A similar thing happens to you at work. It&amp;rsquo;s barely possible to love the work over a long period. As a solution to that, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to leave for a vacation occasionally.</description>

      <title>#5 - Black and White</title>

      <description>Life doesn&amp;rsquo;t consist of black and white. There are always the shades of grey which fill the void between them with a gradient. In life, nothing can be unequivocally evaluated. I can only say with a degree of certainty that objectivity is vague and can be arguably existent in mathematics and physics. Also, people say there is some level of objectivity while looking through the viewfinder of a video recorder.</description>
