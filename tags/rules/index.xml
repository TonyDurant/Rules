      <description>Hey, I guess we are warming up here. Here is another small one.
 Rule #4: &amp;ldquo;Always Follow the Rules.&amp;rdquo;
 And, yes, I know, some of you would argue that there are occasions where you would step aside from following certain rules. I know it; everyone knows it. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time talking about that.
Nonetheless, some of us follow the rules subconsciously.
All in all, if you want that everything goes smoothly, follow the rules.</description>
