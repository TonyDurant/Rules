# #0 — In place of a prologue

"The Rules" project has been a long-lasting project for me started back in 2010. I was running it in the Russian language, — my mother tongue. Since then "The Rules" has transformed into something bigger, into extended commandments for life if you will. I've been on and off of writing; however, the idea, the guidance it bears, has always been keeping me company throughout my ventures in life. It doesn't matter where I was roaming, it has been helping me a lot with its internal knowledge and wisdom.
 
Here comes the time where I release it into public

"The Rules" is about productivity, concentration, clarity of thought and actions, avoiding traps, and maneuvering between uncertainties of life.
